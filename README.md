# Winter-Internship
Built an algorithm in python to detect the starting and the ending frames of the fog in a video.
Identified foggy frames with an accuracy of 90% based on the Atmospheric Scattering Model Analysis.
Estimated intensity of the foggy level in a frame with execution time of 10-15ms per frame of size 100x100 pixels.
